#PROJECT DESCRIPTION

We will be creating an AirBnB web application clone in Python.
We will be using the cmd module to implement the command interpreter
The data will be stored in a Json file which will be accessed using the json module in python

#DESCRIPTION OF COMMAND INTERPRETER 

The application's interface closely resembles a Bash shell, but it's tailored for a specific set of commands designed exclusively for the AirBnB website's functionality. This command-line interpreter acts as the gateway to the web application, enabling users to engage with the backend, which has been crafted using Python's object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.

#HOW TO START IT

We need to simply open the ubuntu webterminal

#HOW TO USE IT

The application operates in two distinct modes:

Interactive Mode:
In interactive mode, the console presents a "hbnb" prompt, signifying that the user can input and execute commands. Once a command is executed, the prompt reappears, ready for the user's next input. This mode can continue indefinitely, as long as the user chooses not to exit the program.

Non-interactive Mode:
Non-interactive mode requires running the shell with a command input piped into its execution. As soon as the shell starts, the provided command is executed without any user interaction. In this mode, no prompt appears, and the shell does not expect any additional input from the user.
